          <strong>Samibel</strong> is NOT a language, it's a phonetic system. Yet it still can be called a "language" or a "phonetic language" in
          a casual discussion. Like morse code, it's a system not a language, yet people still call it a "language".
        </p>

        <p>
          It was created by Sami M. Bellabd, a.k.a. SMB, for the purpose of making a "language" that can transliterate ANY language of the world, or
          generally any sound the human mouth can make, no matter how absurd and ridiculous it sounds, whether it's a raspberry blow, a whistle...
          you name it.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <abbr title="International Phonetics Alphabet" class="ipa-abbr">IPA</abbr> already exists for such a purpose, yet it still lacks lots of sounds
          despite that it has more than 100 letters of different kinds of sounds, but <strong>Samibel</strong> is here to beat the record, allowing as much
          sound the human mouth can make and speak, a brand-new, better, comprehensive, and more accurate syntax than the one used worldwide. It has
          over 70 letters so far (Still a work in progress), including accents for transitioning, detailed arcticulations, and diphthongs.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was called <strong><i>Samibel</i></strong> after—What you would call—the "<i>Samibeldional</i>" ("Alphabetical" but for Samibel) order of letters
          according to the sounds that they make (which is called <i>Samibeldion</i> by the way), which was inspired by the pronounciation of the name of the
          creator of this phonetic system, Sami Bellabd, which he exactly took the first 6 letters of his name: /samibɛl/. Also fun fact, the rest is followed
          by the pronounciation of the name of the love of his live /aɪəʊnə wʊlsənkrɒft/ cause it just felt right for him, then after deleting the repeated
          phonetics, we get something like this: /samibɛldɪəʊnwlsnkrɒft.../ and the order continues until it reaches its end, it's long so we're not gonna
          type all of it here, except that its written in Samibel letters rather than IPA ones.
        </p>

        <p>
          For a unique use, it has its own new fresh looking symbols and letters that each would symbolize a specific sound, there are few resemblance in
          existing languages like the latin letter "V" that does also exist in Samibel, yet such <i>Samibelical</i> letters were not inspired from these
          languages, and the "V" symbol is pronounced /s/<span class="sub-ipa">(In IPA)</span> in Samibel, which is also the first letter in Samibeldion.
          There you go, congratulations! you learned your first letter in Samibel! Shall we move on to more letters?
