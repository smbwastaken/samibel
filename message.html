    Dear Iona,
    <br><br>
    I hope you’re doing okay, first, I want to be sorry for any trouble I got you in. And I wanted to send you a physical letter to show you how much you mean to me, and that it's not impossible to achieve what we want to achieve, you are now officially holding something I held before, pretty crazy right? I was afraid and excited at the same time to send you this letter, but I sent it encrypted. Good job for decrypting it.
    <br>
    I really can't forget the times we enjoyed together, our video chats, playing Minecraft together, talking about the things we love, making songs together, bumping and screen kissing, the "I love you more" fights, staring at each other until we sleep, laughing together, and mostly enjoying how much we love each other, and I don't want all of this to evaporate as if nothing happened, I hope it was (or will be) a long-term relationship, and I hope it will lead us to marry then, there's only three months left for our one year anniversary and I can't wait for it! Anyway, I will try my best to reach you, and we will make the best future version of ourselves together, no matter what happens to you, I will always be there for you, I love you, Iona, I really do, and will always do, and I really hope you do too. We can make a difference in this world, I zwoot you.
    <br><br>
    Your soulmate, Sami.
